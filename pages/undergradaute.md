  We offer undergraduate majors in general anthropology, human biology and 
  anthropology and visual communication, and minors in general anthropology and 
  anthropology of visual communication.
---
Undergraduate majors in anthropology pursue one of three courses of study: General Anthropology, the Human Biology track or the Anthropology of Visual Communication track. Laboratory facilities, internships, fieldwork and experiential learning courses provide students with practical experience in all of anthropology’s subdisciplines. A minor is also available in General Anthropology and in Anthropology of Visual Communication.

You will have the opportunity to collaborate with faculty on field research in locations around the world, from biological research in Oman, to sociocultural research in India, to archeological research right here in the Delaware Valley.
