  We offer undergraduate majors in general anthropology, human biology and 
  anthropology and visual communication, and minors in general anthropology and 
  anthropology of visual communication.
---
Undergraduate majors in anthropology pursue one of three courses of study: [General Anthropology](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/anthropology/general-anthropology-major/), the [Human Biology track](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/anthropology/human-biology-concentration/) or the [Anthropology of Visual Communication track](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/anthropology/visual-anthropology-concentration/). Laboratory facilities, internships, fieldwork and experiential learning courses provide students with practical experience in all of anthropology’s subdisciplines. Minors are also available in [General Anthropology](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/anthropology/general_anthropology-minor/) and in [Anthropology of Visual Communication](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/anthropology/visual-anthropology-minor/).

## What is Anthropology?

Anthropology is the study, from multiple perspectives, of humanity's origins, development, activities and experiences, throughout time and throughout the world. Drawing on a wide range of theoretical and methodological approaches, anthropologists seek answers to such questions as: What does it mean to be human? How have humans developed over the course of time? What human universals can be identified, and what is the range of human diversity, both physical and cultural? How do people interact with their physical and social environments? How and to what extent does being a speaker of a particular language or languages affect the ways in which one perceives and experiences the world? How do historical, social, cultural, politico-economic and ecological factors shape the lives of particular groups of people, and of particular individuals within those groups? 

## Anthropology at Temple

Anthropology comprises four subdisciplines, all of which are well represented at Temple: archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and sociocultural anthropology. We also offer specialized courses and training in anthropology of visual communication (which draws primarily on linguistic anthropology and sociocultural anthropology). 

You will have the opportunity to collaborate with faculty on field research in locations around the world, from biological research in Oman, to sociocultural research in India, to archeological research right here in the Delaware Valley.
