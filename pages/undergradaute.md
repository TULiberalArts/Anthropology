## Major in Anthropology at Temple
If you join the Department of Anthropology, you will collaborate with faculty on field research in locations around the world, from biological research in Oman, to socio-cultural research in India, to archeological research right here in the Delaware Valley. Anthropology majors at Temple gain a foundation in all of the four sub-fields associated with the discipline - archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology and sociocultural anthropology. 

We offer the flexibility to pursue your interest in specific sub-fields, or if you'd rather, pursue a more general undergraduate program. Studying anthropology helps build the creative thinking and critical analysis needed to solve complex problems. We teach cross-cultural understanding, interdisciplinary connection, computational and analytical skills. With our training, you’ll be able to connect on a deeper level with people from many linguistic and geographical backgrounds, and generate key insights into how people make sense and meaning in their worlds.

## BA in Human Biology
The Human Biology Concentration in Anthropology prepares you for careers in healthcare that include dentistry, medicine, optometry, physical therapy and podiatry. Human Biology students take courses that emphasize an evolutionary perspective on humans and cover human genetics, human paleontology, human physiology and human reproductive biology and behavior. Our curriculum also includes biology courses amd elective options in human anatomy, physiology and public health. Graduates who earn a BA in Anthropology with a Human Biology Concentration gain the broad, liberal arts background that many professional schools find attractive. If you're interested in this concentration, contact the Human Biology Concentration advisor, Dr. Charles Weitz, at 215-204-7330 or [weitz@temple.edu](mailto:weitz@temple.edu).
