## Major in Anthropology at Temple
If you join the Department of Anthropology, you will collaborate with faculty on field research in locations around the world, from biological research in Oman, to socio-cultural research in India, to archeological research right here in the Delaware Valley. Antropology majors at Temple gain a foundation in all of the four sub-fields associated with the discipline. These sub-fields are archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology and sociocultural anthropology. As an anthropology major, you will develop the ability to apply theories to the interpretation of artifacts and other data, develop research programs and proposals, formulate hypotheses and gather ethnographic information through participant-observation. We offer the flexibility to pursue your interest in specific sub-fields, or if you'd rather, pursue a more general undergraduate program. Studying anthropology helps build the creative thinking and critical analysis needed to solve complex problems. We teach cross-cultural understanding, interdisciplinary connection, computational and analytical skills. With our training, you’ll be able to connect on a deeper level with people from many linguistic and geographical backgrounds, and generate key insights into how people make sense and meaning in their worlds.

## BA in Antrhopology: Human Biology Concentration
The Human Biology concentration in Anthropology prepares students for careers in medicine, dentistry, physical therapy, optometry, podiatry, and other allied health fields. Human Biology students major in Anthropology but take departmental courses primarily in biological anthropology. These courses deal in human genetics, human paleontology, human physiology, and human reproductive biology and behavior. They stress an evolutionary perspective on humans and integrate molecular, whole-organism, population, and species-level data on humans. The Human Biology concentration also includes required courses in biology, and elective options in human anatomy, physiology, and public health. This program also encourages students to take courses in other disciplines to fulfill admission requirements to professional schools in the health sciences. As a result, our students have the broad, liberal arts background that many professional schools find attractive.

## Minor in Anthropology
The Minor in Philosophy is an excellent way to extend the breadth of your education and understanding of the world. Whether you plan to become a lawyer, a teacher or a doctor, our Minor in Philosophy program makes the development of strong communication and reasoning skills a priority. A Philosophy Minor helps you stand out when you apply for jobs or graduate school, because it shows that you have a well-rounded education.
