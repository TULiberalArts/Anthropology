## We Have Restructured Graduate Programs! 
The newly restructured graduate programs in Anthropology provide students with training that integrates the four traditional subfields of the discipline and organizes their engagement with anthropology around two thematic areas. The first, Mobility and Global Inequality, emphasizes social processes and institutions that underlie the impact of peoples’ movement and the experiences they encounter in terms of social inequalities, resource distribution and power inequities. It is marked by the emphasis on ethnographic, linguistic, and visual data and analytical methods grounded in contemporary theory in the social sciences. The second thematic area, Evolution and Human Environments emphasizes the origins and development of all forms of human adaptations in the biosocial realm. It is marked by an emphasis on ecological, geographic and spatial-historical data, and quantitative analyses grounded in evolutionary theory. All students in the program complete a set of core courses, which include foundational courses in the thematic areas and history of the discipline. 

Additional core courses provide professional training in ethics and grant writing in the discipline. Students complete elective courses allowing them to specialize in the literature, theory, and unique sub-disciplinary perspectives most relevant to their intended career goals or dissertation research. Faculty from the subfields of Pre-historic and Historic Archaeology, Bioarchaeology, Biological Anthropology, Sociocultural Anthropology, Linguistic Anthropology, Visual Anthropology and Medical Anthropology contribute to the program.

## Master of Arts in Anthropology
Our new, 2-year, MA Program is intended for students who seek advanced training in Social Sciences in preparation for a PhD program or employment outside academia. The program is structured along two thematic lines: Evolution and Human Environments, and Mobility and Global Inequality. A comprehensive exam is the culminating event. There is no thesis option. You can view our departmental [Master of Arts Brochure]((https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tq9coiBQfv4YPG7ac7JPjuiKBrU2AUGR/view?usp=sharing)) to read more about the program, see program requirements and more.

- Please email the [Director of Graduate Studies](Christie.Rockwell@temple.edu) to inquire about applications and for further details.

## PhD in Anthropology 
Anthropology comprises four subdisciplines, all of which are represented at Temple: Archaeology, Biological Anthropology, Linguistic Anthropology, and Sociocultural Anthropology. In addition the Department also offers specialized courses and training in the Anthropology of Visual Communication. Doctoral students typically specialize in one of these areas, but interdisciplinary study and research are encouraged. Students complete two years of course work prior to beginning their Dissertation research. Well over 100 doctoral degrees have been conferred by the Department of Anthropology since 1976.

## Admission Requirements
### MA Admissions 
Before you apply to our MA in Anthropology program, it is recommended that you contact the [Director of Graduate Studies](Christie.Rockwell@temple.edu) to discuss your interest in the program. A BA or BS degree is required. Two letters of recommendation and a statement of interest are required. GRE scores are not required. Financial support is not available for MA students. 

### PhD Admissions
Before you apply to our PhD in Anthropology program, establish personal contact with at least one faculty member at the Department of Anthropology whose research interests overlap with yours and who might serve as an academic advisor. It is also recommended that you contact the Director of Graduate Studies to discuss your interest in the program. As an applicant to our PhD program, you should have a bachelor’s degree, but it does not need to be in anthropology. You are not required to have a master’s degree. The minimum admission standard for all graduate students is an undergraduate grade point average of B, or 3.0 or the functional equivalent for students who attended universities outside the United States. GRE scores and a written statement of interest are required. TOFEL scores are required for international students. Three letters of recommendation from individuals familiar with your academic work are also required. The number of applicants accepted each year varies depending on such factors as our ability to offer financial support and the availability of faculty members to serve as advisors to new students. In recent years, our newly incoming cohorts have generally had four to six students.
