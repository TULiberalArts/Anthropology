## Earn a PhD in Anthropology from Temple University
The graduate program in anthropology is a highly selective doctoral program leading to a PhD degree in Anthropology. Anthropology comprises four subdisciplines, all of which are well represented at Temple:  Archaeology, Biological Anthropology, Linguistic Anthropology, and Sociocultural Anthropology. The Department also offers specialized courses and training in the Anthropology of Visual Communication, which draws primarily on Linguistic Anthropology and Sociocultural Anthropology. Doctoral students typically specialize in one of these areas, but interdisciplinary study and research are encouraged. Well over 100 doctoral degrees have been conferred by the Department of Anthropology since 1976. 

## Anthropology PhD Job Placement
Approximately 45% of doctoral graduates hold full-time faculty positions in colleges or universities, while another 20% hold full-time research positions in academic or non-academic settings. Another 20% hold degree-related policy and administrative positions and 10% are engaged in other professional activities. 

## Admission Requirements
As an applicant to our graduate programs in English, you should have the equivalent of an undergraduate concentration in English with broad chronological coverage of literature or have completed equivalent coursework. Before preparing and submitting the application for admission, the applicant should, if at all possible, establish personal contact with at least one faculty member in Temple's Department of Anthropology. This should be a faculty member whose areas of research interest overlap with those of the applicant, and who could potentially serve as her/his faculty advisor.

## Temple Graduate School Funding
Outstanding applicants are nominated for Temple University's Presidential, University, and Future Faculty Fellowships, which provide four years of tuition remission, a living stipend, and other benefits. Limited numbers of Teaching and Research Assistantships are also available for well-qualified applicants. Students are strongly encouraged to apply for external grants and fellowships. For more information review our application instructions.
