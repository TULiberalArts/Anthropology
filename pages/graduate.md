## Earn a PhD in Anthropology from Temple University

The graduate program in anthropology is a highly selective doctoral program leading to a PhD degree in Anthropology. Anthropology comprises four subdisciplines, all of which are well represented at Temple: Archaeology, Biological Anthropology, Linguistic Anthropology, and Sociocultural Anthropology. The Department also offers specialized courses and training in the Anthropology of Visual Communication, which draws primarily on Linguistic Anthropology and Sociocultural Anthropology. Doctoral students typically specialize in one of these areas, but interdisciplinary study and research are encouraged. Well over 100 doctoral degrees have been conferred by the Department of Anthropology since 1976. 

Please visit the [Anthropology Graduate Bulletin](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/anthropology-phd/#admissiontext) to learn more about graduate program requirements, dates and deadlines and instructions on how to apply.

## Anthropology PhD Job Placement
Approximately 45% of doctoral graduates hold full-time faculty positions in colleges or universities, while another 20% hold full-time research positions in academic or non-academic settings. Another 20% hold degree-related policy and administrative positions and 10% are engaged in other professional activities. 

## Admission Requirements
Before you apply to our PhD in Anthropology program, establish personal contact with at least one faculty member at the Department of Anthropology whose research interests overlap with yours and who might serve as an academic advisor. As an applicant to our graduate program, you should have a bachelor’s degree, but it does not need to be in anthropology. You are not required to have a master’s degree. 

The number of applicants accepted each year varies, depending on such factors as the our ability to offer financial support and the availability of faculty members to serve as advisors to new students. In recent years, our newly incoming cohorts have generally had four to six students. The minimum admission standard for all graduate students is an undergraduate grade point average of B, or 3.0 or the functional equivalent for students who attended universities outside the United States.
