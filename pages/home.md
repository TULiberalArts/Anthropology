  Anthropologists pursue the comprehensive study of humans. Since the
  evolutionary origin of our species, we have grown to a population over 7
  billion that lives in dynamic tension with our social, cultural, and
  ecological environments. In our programs, students learn about deep time,
  human pre-history, health and human biology, mobility, global inequalities,
  cultural resilience, modern communication and mediation, multilingualism,
  cultural politics, and more. They graduate prepared to pursue graduate studies
  in Anthropology or related studies or to use this perspective to contribute to
  a large variety of non-academic career paths.
