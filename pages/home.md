  Studying anthropology helps build the creative thinking and critical analysis needed to solve complex problems.
  We teach cross-cultural understanding, interdisciplinary connection, computational and analytical skills. With our
  training, you’ll be able to connect on a deeper level with people from many linguistic and geographical backgrounds,
  and generate key insights into how people make sense and meaning in their worlds.
