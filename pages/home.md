  Anthropologists pursue the comprehensive study of humans. Since the evolutionary origin of
  our species, we have grown to a population over 7 billion that lives in dynamic tension with our
  social, cultural, and ecological environments. In our programs, students learn about deep time,
  human pre-history, health and human biology, mobility, global inequalities, cultural resilience,
  modern communication and mediation, multilingualism, cultural politics, and more. They
  graduate prepared to pursue graduate studies in Anthropology or related studies or to use this
  perspective to contribute to a large variety of non-academic career paths.
