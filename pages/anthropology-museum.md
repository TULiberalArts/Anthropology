The Department of Anthropology provides a number of hands-on training opportunities in research-active labs. Classroom lectures are great tools for providing foundational knowledge, but one of the best ways to study anthropology is by doing anthropological work. At Temple University, students in our Anthropology program get the opportunity for hands-on learning in our [biology](#biological-anthropology-research-lab), [linguistic](#linguistic-anthropology-laboratory) and [media](#media-anthropology-laboratory) labs.

## Anthropology Museum
The Temple Anthropology Laboratory Museum is home to anthropological collections from all over the world. House posts and funerary canoes from the Solomon Islands sit alongside pottery from Metepec, Mexico; feather headdresses from the Cashinahua people of Peru; and 10,000 year-old spear points from right here in Pennsylvania. Temple students create exhibits on Pennsylvania’s indigenous past, textile production in Argentina and music in Papua, New Guinea. They also help catalog and care for museum objects, take photographs for 3D modeling and create virtual exhibits. They also museum analyze archaeological collections—sometimes after doing the excavations themselves.


For more information, visit the museum’s [website](https://www.tuanthmuseum.com/) created entirely by Temple students (including all of the photography). Or come visit us in Gladfelter Hall – see the website for updated hours.

Many Temple undergraduate students come through the museum doors, often as part of Anthropology or Latin American Studies courses. Many others participate in collections-based research projects with Anthropology faculty. If you are interested in working in the museum, please contact the director for information about taking the Practicum in Curation and Collections Management. Students in this 1-credit-hour course choose from projects digitizing collections, creating exhibits or performing research on museum materials.

Our collections include:

- Ethnological material from the Solomon Islands and other parts of the South Pacific.
- Ethnological material from the Amazon basin.
- Archaeological collections from sites in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey.
- Collections transferred from the Philadelphia Commercial Museum.

If you would like to visit the museum, access the collections, or use the laboratory facilities, please contact the director at [anthlab@temple.edu](mailto:anthlab@temple.edu). For more information, visit the [Anthropology Lab website](http://gamma.library.temple.edu/anthropologylab/).

### Resources and Opportunities
Laboratory facilities, internships, fieldwork and experiential learning courses provide our students with practical experiences across all anthropology’s subdisciplines. 

Our [Internship in Anthropology course](https://bulletin.temple.edu/search/?search=ANTH+4185) offers students a chance to receive credit for internships related to their study of anthropology. Students coordinate their internship activities with a faculty member as well as their internship supervisor. They keep a journal of their activities and write a concluding paper that summarizes their work and its relationship to the way they will use the experience after they graduate.

Periodically, the department offers a summer Archaeological Field School in which students participate in an archaeological excavation at a site in eastern Pennsylvania or in southern New Jersey. In addition to these opportunities several faculty members involve students in their personal research projects.

[Dr. Leslie Reeder-Myers](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/reeder-myers-leslie) is an archaeologist who studies ancient sustainable fisheries. Students often help with her fieldwork in Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay and they analyze collections from archaeological excavations in Honduras and California as well. This is archaeology making a difference--using the past to understand how to get ecosystems back on track today.

[Dr. Paul Farnsworth](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/farnsworth-paul) is an archaeologist who studies the development of African-Caribbean cultures and identities during the colonial period in the English-speaking Caribbean. Each summer a handful of students accompany him to Anguilla to assist in archaeological excavations, and the cataloguing and analysis of the artifacts recovered from them. The following fall semester, some of these students carry out independent studies on an aspect of the project that particularly interests them using the data recovered by the project.

[Dr. Michael Hesson](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/hesson-michael) is a linguistic and cultural anthropologist who studies Yucatec Maya language and culture. Students often assist him with his research on Linguistic Relativity—the hypothesis that language structures affect ways of thinking and behaving. This research, which he has carried out with Yucatec and more recently with Japanese, has the potential to yield a deeper and more nuanced understanding of how cultural beliefs are formed.

[Dr. Kimberly Williams](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/williams-kimberly-d) is an archaeologist whose current research is focused on mortuary and landscape archaeology in Southeastern Arabia. Students have assisted Dr. Williams in her excavations of Early Bronze Age burial sites in Oman. This research contributes to our understanding of prehistoric mortuary ritual, funerary landscape formation and use, interred material culture, and archaeological human skeletal remains all recovered through survey and excavation.

_Other faculty members also may involve students in their research. Interested students should consult our faculty's profile pages to find out more about their research activities._

## Research Labs
### Biological Anthropology Teaching Laboratory
The Biological Anthropology Teaching Laboratory is dedicated for use in introductory and upper division courses human osteology, human paleontology, human growth and development, human genetics, human reproduction and health, and primatology. It contains a large study collection of human skeletons and dental casts for use in our anatomy and osteology classes. The Teaching Laboratory also houses an extensive and up-to-date collection of casts of human ancestors and their relatives such as Neanderthals. We maintain a comparative non-human primate skeletal collection, and other select mammalian materials. In addition, we have models of DNA molecules and equipment used for physiological measurements and radiographic assessments. The teaching lab is outfitted with smart-classroom capabilities to support film viewing, lecture and student presentations, and WEB based instruction. Most classes in biological anthropology are held in this facility, which seats 30 students, and make regular use of the collections. Open-lab study hours are made by arrangement with course instructors.

### Linguistic Anthropology Laboratory
The Linguistic Anthropology Teaching Laboratory, or "LingAnth Lab," is devoted to the collection and analysis of audio- and video-recorded ethnographic data.  It supports the teaching, training, grant-getting, research, and publishing endeavors of faculty members, doctoral students, and advanced undergraduate students, particularly those whose work involves recording and closely analyzing naturally occurring language use and interactions.  Currently, faculty and students affiliated with the LingAnth Lab have research and writing projects underway based on data collected in the Greater Philadelphia area as well as in Angola, Argentina, Aruba, Colombia, Curaçao, the Dominican Republic, Peru, St. Lucia, Spain, and Vietnam.

In recent years, doctoral students affiliated with the LingAnth Lab have been awarded many of the most prestigious grants and fellowships that are available to support doctoral research in anthropology.  These include the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; the Fulbright Fellowship; the Fulbright–Hays Fellowship; the Wenner-Gren Foundation Dissertation Fieldwork Grant; the National Security Education Program Boren Fellowship; and the National Academy of Education Spencer Dissertation Fellowship.

### Media Anthropology Laboratory
Reflecting one focus of faculty and student research, The Department of Anthropology features a Media Anthropology Lab. The lab houses four double-monitor computer stations for video and sound editing, often used during our visual anthropology courses and other courses that offer opportunities for students to work with video. The lab is also home to a number of camera kits and other equipment (tripods, sound equipment, lights), which can be borrowed by undergraduate students majoring in anthropology, and anthropology graduate students, for their own projects.
