Temple University Anthropology students get a fantastic education, but there’s more to college than what happens in the classroom. Anthropology students can take an [internship course or get involved with research](#internship-and-research-opportunities-for-undergraduate-students) while working with one of our faculty members or join one of our three [student organizations](#undergraduate-anthropology-association-uaa) designed specifically for them. Students are also encouraged to seek grants, publishing deals, media coverage and various other [awards](#student-accomplishments-and-accolades) available to them.

## Internship and Research Opportunities for Undergraduate Students
Laboratory facilities, internships, fieldwork and experiential learning courses provide our students with practical experiences across all anthropology’s subdisciplines. 

Our [Internship in Anthropology course](https://bulletin.temple.edu/search/?search=ANTH+4185) offers students a chance to receive credit for internships related to their study of anthropology. Students coordinate their internship activities with a faculty member as well as their internship supervisor. They keep a journal of their activities and write a concluding paper that summarizes their work and its relationship to the way they will use the experience after they graduate.

Periodically, the department offers a summer Archaeological Field School in which students participate in an archaeological excavation at a site in eastern Pennsylvania or in southern New Jersey. In addition to these opportunities several faculty members involve students in their personal research projects.

[Dr. Leslie Reeder-Myers](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/reeder-myers-leslie) is an archaeologist who studies ancient sustainable fisheries. Students often help with her fieldwork in Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay and they analyze collections from archaeological excavations in Honduras and California as well. This is archaeology making a difference--using the past to understand how to get ecosystems back on track today.

[Dr. Paul Farnsworth](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/farnsworth-paul) is an archaeologist who studies the development of African-Caribbean cultures and identities during the colonial period in the English-speaking Caribbean. Each summer a handful of students accompany him to Anguilla to assist in archaeological excavations, and the cataloguing and analysis of the artifacts recovered from them. The following fall semester, some of these students carry out independent studies on an aspect of the project that particularly interests them using the data recovered by the project.

[Dr. Michael Hesson](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/hesson-michael) is a linguistic and cultural anthropologist who studies Yucatec Maya language and culture. Students often assist him with his research on Linguistic Relativity—the hypothesis that language structures affect ways of thinking and behaving. This research, which he has carried out with Yucatec and more recently with Japanese, has the potential to yield a deeper and more nuanced understanding of how cultural beliefs are formed.

[Dr. Kimberly Williams](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/williams-kimberly-d) is an archaeologist whose current research is focused on mortuary and landscape archaeology in Southeastern Arabia. Students have assisted Dr. Williams in her excavations of Early Bronze Age burial sites in Oman. This research contributes to our understanding of prehistoric mortuary ritual, funerary landscape formation and use, interred material culture, and archaeological human skeletal remains all recovered through survey and excavation.

_Other faculty members also may involve students in their research. Interested students should consult our faculty's profile pages to find out more about their research activities._
 
## Undergraduate Anthropology Association (UAA)
The Undergraduate Anthropology Association is a forum in which anthropology majors and minors can meet one another as well as interact with professors and graduate students. We include all areas of anthropological study: archaeology, anthropology of visual communication, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology and sociocultural anthropology. We hold bi-monthly meetings where professors discuss their areas of specialization and we organize trips to museums and events, a graduate student panel, fundraisers, ethnic food nights, and other fun events. It's a great organization to become involved in, especially if you plan on continuing your studies in anthropology at the graduate level. For further information, contact the association's president, Emily Marron, [emily.marron@temple.edu](mailto:emily.marron@temple.edu) or use the association's email address, [templeuaa@gmail.com](mailto:templeuaa@gmail.com).

## Anthropology Graduate Student Association
The Anthropology Graduate Student Association meets monthly to discuss ongoing developments in the department, to plan events, and to share questions, concerns and current work. We also get together for social events, to attend talks and exhibits, to discuss our research and other work, and to organize visitors to the department. We are open to suggestions and ideas, so if you are a graduate student in the department, please stop by our next meeting! Meeting information is disseminated through the department's graduate-student listserv. The association was established "to assist its members in all endeavors related to their success in the graduate division of Temple University's Anthropology department; this includes educational, peer, and faculty support." For further information, contact the AGSA President, Julien Ehrenkonig, [Julien.ehrenkonig@temple.edu](mailto:Julien.ehrenkonig@temple.edu).

## Visual Anthropology Society at Temple (VAST)
VAST, the Visual Anthropology Society at Temple, is graduate student organization for undergraduate and graduate students interested in visual anthropology, ethnographic film, and the ethnography of media. It meets regularly to watch films and organize events, including a semi-annual academic conference and film screening, called Futures of Visual Anthropology FoVA. The annual FoVA conference was long a fixture of Temple's anthropology department before being revived in 2012, and showcases the ethnographic film and research of Temple students and faculty, as well as the work of national and international scholars. VAST meets and is housed in the department s media anthropology lab, which offers several digital editing workstations as well as cutting edge filmmaking equipment that Temple students are able to borrow for their own projects. Visit our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/VASTvisions/) to learn more about us! For more information contact [Damien Stankiewicz](mailto:damien@temple.edu).
