Undergraduate and graduate resources.

## Undergraduate Resources

Students who are interested in the General Anthropology major or minor, the Human Biology track, or the Anthropology of Visual Communication track should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Prof. Inmaculada García Sánchez, at [igarcias@temple.edu](mailto:igarcias@temple.edu).
 
### Undergraduate Anthropology Association (UAA) 

The Undergraduate Anthropology Association is a forum in which anthropology majors and minors can meet one another as well as interact with professors and graduate students. We include all areas of anthropological study: archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, sociocultural anthropology and anthropology of visual communication. 

We hold bi-monthly meetings where professors discuss their areas of specialization and we organize trips to museums and events, a graduate student panel, fundraisers, ethnic food nights, and other fun events. It's a great organization to become involved in, especially if you seek guidance in continuing your studies in anthropology at the graduate level.

For further information, contact the association's president, Emily Marron, [emily.marron@temple.edu](mailto:emily.marron@temple.edu) or use the association's email address, [templeuaa@gmail.com](mailto:templeuaa@gmail.com). 

## Graduate Resources

For detailed information about the Temple University Graduate School's requirements and procedures, which apply to all doctoral students in all departments, refer to Temple University's Graduate [website](http://www.temple.edu/grad/policies/gradpolicies.htm).

### Anthropology Graduate Student Association

The Anthropology Graduate Student Association meets monthly to discuss ongoing developments in the department, to plan events, and to share questions, concerns and current work. We also get together for social events, to attend talks and exhibits, to discuss our research and other work, and to organize visitors to the department. We are open to suggestions and ideas, so if you are a graduate student in the department, please stop by our next meeting! Meeting information is disseminated through the department's graduate-student listserv. The association was established "to assist its members in all endeavors related to their success in the graduate division of Temple University's Anthropology department; this includes educational, peer, and faculty support." For further information, contact our president, Dana Muñíz Pacheco, [d.munizpacheco@temple.edu](mailto:d.munizpacheco@temple.edu).
