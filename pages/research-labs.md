## Biological Anthropology Research Lab

_[Dr. Christie Rockwell](mailto:christie.rockwell@temple.edu), Director_

The Biological Anthropology Research Lab is a 450 sq. ft. wet-lab within the Anthropology Department. It contains a Biosafety Cabinet, Plate Reader, Freezers and Refrigerator, Centrifuges, as well as Inverted and Trifocal Light Microscopes with high magnification optics. The lab is suitable for immunocyto- and immunohistochemistry. There is a computer workstation configured with Linux OS enabling researchers to connect to Temple University’s High Performance Computing Environment where bioinformatics and other Big Data analysis can be done. The facility is available for graduate student research (with permission). Recent student dissertation projects include the following:
 
**Kristin Almskaar, MA, ABD**
_The Role of the Placental Microbiome in Reproductive - Immune Trade-offs Associated with Pre-term Birth: A Life History Perspective._
 
**Andrew Van Horn, MA, ABD**
_Quantification and Phylogenetic Comparative Analysis of Pelage Sexual Dichromatism in Primates._
 
**Elizabeth Rowe, PhD**
_The Impact of Variation in the Progesterone Receptor Gene, Life History, and Lifestyle on Endometrial Function and the Menstrual Cycle.”_

## Biological Anthropology Teaching Laboratory

## Linguistic Anthropology Laboratory

The Linguistic Anthropology Teaching Laboratory, or "LingAnth Lab," is devoted to the collection and analysis of audio- and video-recorded ethnographic data.  It supports the teaching, training, grant-getting, research, and publishing endeavors of faculty members, doctoral students, and advanced undergraduate students, particularly those whose work involves recording and closely analyzing naturally occurring language use and interactions.  Currently, faculty and students affiliated with the LingAnth Lab have research and writing projects underway based on data collected in the Greater Philadelphia area as well as in Angola, Argentina, Aruba, Colombia, Curaçao, the Dominican Republic, Peru, St. Lucia, Spain, and Vietnam. 

In recent years, doctoral students affiliated with the LingAnth Lab have been awarded many of the most prestigious grants and fellowships that are available to support doctoral research in anthropology.  These include the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship; the Fulbright Fellowship; the Fulbright–Hays Fellowship; the Wenner-Gren Foundation Dissertation Fieldwork Grant; the National Security Education Program Boren Fellowship; and the National Academy of Education Spencer Dissertation Fellowship.

## Visual Anthropology Laboratory

Reflecting one focus of faculty and student research, The Department of Anthropology features a Media Anthropology Lab. The lab houses four double-monitor computer stations for video and sound editing, often used during our visual anthropology courses and other courses that offer opportunities for students to work with video. The lab is also home to a number of camera kits and other equipment (tripods, sound equipment, lights), which can be borrowed by undergraduate students majoring in anthropology, and anthropology graduate students, for their own projects.
